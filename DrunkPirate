# A drunk pirate makes a random turn and then takes 100 steps forward, makes another
# random turn, takes another 100 steps, turns another random amount, etc. A social science
# student records the angle of each turn before the next 100 steps are taken. Her experimental
# data is [160, -43, 270, -97, -43, 200, -940, 17, -86]. (Positive angles are counter-clockwise.) Use a
# turtle to draw the path taken by our drunk friend.
